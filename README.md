# Final-Year-Project
Hand Gesture Interface Based Touchless Exploration of Medical Images Using Deep Learning Approaches
Gesture is an important means of communication and gesture recognition technology has opened up a new situation of human interaction with machines, devices or computers.
Touchless Human-Machine Interface is an interdisciplinary field with applications in robotics, computer gaming, medical and sign-language interpretation.
By removing the need for touch screens on could help reduce the number of germs being spread. This is especially helpful for mitigating the spread of infectious diseases such a Covid-19 or influenza.



Usability of touchless image viewers in the field of medical.

Availability of patient-specific image data, gathered from diagnostic procedure like X-rays, CT scans, MRI during the preoperative planning stage. The availability of these images in the operating room has been identified as a factor for patient safety.

Traditionally, the patient's X-ray films would be hung up in front of a lightbox in the operating room, these lightboxes have been substituted by digital monitors. This offers the added benefit of being able to navigate (scroll) through a tomography data set 

The user is able to manipulate images by zooming into a region of interest or changing contrast and brightness. All these features require the interaction of the user with the system, which leads to a unique set of challenges since a doctor in the operating room is not able to use common input devices like keyboards and mice because of bacterial contamination. 

The use of hand gestures is an established way of interacting with software in a sterile environment  and their usage seems to be favorable compared to relaying verbal instructions to a non-sterile assistant.
